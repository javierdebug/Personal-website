                      This Single Page Application (SPA) project was created using React with TypeScript, delivering a powerful and intuitive user experience. This web application allows users to easily access detailed information about countries around the world, using a GraphQL API as the source of data. The user can refine the results by typing the name of the country or by using filters for continent and currency. The SPA was deployed using Firebase, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. This project showcases my ability to create effective and user-friendly web applications using the latest technologies.

                    <p>
                      Project developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, 
                      it performs different Math functions one would use to resolve 
                      advanced Math calculations. I had to assure the quality of the 
                      calculator app, no failures should be present. The tricky part 
                      is that some Math calculations can be expressed very differently, 
                      some people may use many parentheses (or omit them), power, change 
                      sign (positive to negative or vice versa), so I must check many
                      test cases to assure the calculator works as intended.

                    <p>
                      Created from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                      This type of application is called a CRUD app because it is
                      able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data from the client 
                      and arrange the elements displayed in the HTML canvas 
                      window. This app uses the Local Storage property from the 
                      browser, this way the app is able to storage the user's 
                      data even after reloading or closing the tab.

                      Created from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                      This responsive web app is able to create random passwords 
                      according to the user's inputs, such as the length of the 
                      password, what characters to include (numbers, letters, 
                      special). The application relies on event handling and is 
                      able to arrange and manipulate DOM elements.
